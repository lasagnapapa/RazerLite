### Notes for LineageOS Aura

- There's a known issue with using Aura on the Razer Phone 2 in a locked horizontal screen orientation that causes the pin lock to be cropped incorrectly. The best fix for this is to use a pattern lock. While it may be frustrating if you tend to use the same passwords on your devices, and don't want to use a pattern. But I really recommend it, as it makes the experience look and feel more seamless.
